Python for Data Analytics – Learning Journey
This repository documents my daily progress in learning Python with a focus on
Data Analytics. It covers Python fundamentals, functional programming, and data
handling concepts through hands-on practice.

Day 1 – Python Data Types & Collections
*Learned basic Python data types: tuple, set, dictionary
*Practiced set operations and understood that sets store unique values
*Created dictionaries using zip()
* Understood mutable vs immutable data structures

Day 2 – Functions in Python
*Learned how to define functions
*Practiced:
*Functions without return values
*Functions with return values
*Understood function calling and parameter passing

Day 3 – Arguments & Control Flow
*Explored different types of function arguments:
*Positional arguments
*Keyword arguments
*Default arguments
*Variable-length arguments (*args)
*Practiced user input handling
*Wrote programs using conditional statements:
*Even/Odd check
*Vowel/Consonant
*Voting eligibility
*Leap year check
*Divisibility checks
*Learned basic use of exec() (executing user input code)

Day 4 – Math, Lambda & Functional Programming
*Used Python’s math module for mathematical operations
*Learned and practiced lambda functions
*Applied lambda with:
  map()
  filter()
  reduce()
*Implemented reduce logic using both def and lambda
*Strengthened understanding of functional programming concepts

Day 5 – Advanced Functions & Modules
*Learned higher-order functions (functions returning functions)
*Practiced table generation using lambda functions
*Implemented factorial using recursion (without built-in functions)
*Worked with string concatenation
*Used the turtle module to draw polygons
*Practiced accessing nested data structures (list, tuple, set, dictionary)

Day 6 – Python Lists & Operations
*Learned list slicing techniques
*Practiced adding, deleting, and modifying list elements
*Used list methods:
*insert(), extend(), pop(), del
*Learned list replication
*Understood shallow copy vs slicing copy
*Verified object identity using id()

Day 7 – List Manipulation & Shallow Copy
* Practiced advanced list slicing  
* Inserted and extended elements in lists  
* Deleted portions of lists using slicing and del  
* Used pop() to remove elements  
* Added multiple elements in the middle of a list  
* Replicated lists using multiplication operator  
* Copied lists using copy() and slicing  
* Compared object identities using id()  
* Understood shallow copy behavior with nested lists  

Day 8 – List Comprehension & Conditional Logic

* Learned list comprehension (important concept)  
* Generated cube of numbers using:  
  * Traditional for loop  
  * Single-line list comprehension  
* Separated even and odd numbers using loops  
* Used conditional list comprehension  
* Applied inline if-else inside list comprehension  
* Strengthened logic building using conditions  

Day 9 – List Traversal & Built-in Functions

* Accessed list elements using for loop  
* Used range(len()) to access index and value  
* Used enumerate() to get index and value together  
* Traversed nested lists  
* Reversed lists using slicing  
* Sorted lists using sorted()  
* Sorted in descending order  
* Performed membership checks using in keyword  

 Day 10 – Tuples & Tuple Operations

* Created tuples with single and multiple values  
* Practiced tuple unpacking  
* Used placeholder variable (_) during unpacking  
* Accessed tuple elements using indexing  
* Used negative indexing  
* Accessed nested tuple elements  
* Iterated through tuples using loops  
* Used enumerate() with tuples  
* Performed tuple concatenation  
* Applied tuple slicing  
* Reversed tuples using slicing  

Day 11 – Sets & Set Operations

*Created sets with unique elements
*Understood that sets do not allow duplicate values
*Performed set union using | and union()
*Performed set intersection using & and intersection()
*Used difference() to find elements present in one set but not the other
*Used symmetric difference ^ to get unique elements from both sets
*Added elements to a set using add()
*Removed elements using remove()
*Used discard() to remove elements safely (without error if not present)
*Iterated through sets using loops
*Generated new sets using set comprehension
*Applied conditional logic inside set comprehension
*Calculated squares and cubes based on even/odd conditions
*Found common elements between two sets and performed operations on them

Day 12 – Dictionaries & Dictionary Operations

*Created dictionaries with key–value pairs
*Accessed dictionary values using keys
*Used get() method to access values safely
*Added new key–value pairs
*Updated existing dictionary values
*Removed elements using pop()
*Used popitem() to remove the last inserted pair
*Used del keyword to delete specific keys
*Retrieved all keys using keys()
*Retrieved all values using values()
*Retrieved key–value pairs using items()
*Iterated through dictionaries using loops
*Used dictionary comprehension
*Created dictionaries from lists using zip()
*Checked if a key exists in a dictionary
*Nested dictionaries and accessed nested values

 Day 13 – Zip Function, Built-in Functions & Strings

*Used zip() function to combine multiple iterables
*Created a dictionary using dict(zip(keys, values))
*Iterated over zipped objects using loops
